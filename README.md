# Twitter word counter
---
It takes the tweets from any account, splits them into words and count them to see which are the most used.

To start the app we run it in the command line, and we pass the username from which we want to get the tweets as a sys argument
## Exemple
C:\\...\python get_tweets.py @JonathanElejald
